# cootie-catcher
This program is inspired from an origami game called "Cootie Catcher" with secret messages or fortunes inside. 
It's a game I would play in elementary school and decided would be a fun project to
base my first program built from scratch that is not prompted by an exercise from a book or a 
course. I also wanted to practice writing a test case and testing the code for bugs - which I found many
and fixed. 

Here is a link for more information on the physical cootie catch if anyone wants a visual: [Paper Fortune Teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_fortune_teller)
 

## Getting Started
This is written in Python 3.6.1 and can be run in the terminal or idle running Python 3.6.1.  
There is not a web app built or visual for this yet so if you do not have that version of Python
on your system then you can plug the code into: [repl.it](https://repl.it/) using Python 3

You should expect questions and a secret message at the end
